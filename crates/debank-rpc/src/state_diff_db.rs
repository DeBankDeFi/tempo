/// A database that wraps an external database and an in-memory diff database.
///
/// - `Database` (mutable) reads/writes go through `db` (typically a `StateCacheDb`
///   which has an internal cache). During block replay, subsequent txs see prior
///   commits via this cache.
/// - `DatabaseRef` (immutable) reads also delegate to `db`, but `State`'s
///   `DatabaseRef` impl bypasses its cache and reads the underlying provider
///   directly. This means `basic_ref()` returns the original parent-block state,
///   not state modified by prior commits. This is fine for our use case — only
///   `pre_db` uses `DatabaseRef` for diff comparison.
/// - `DatabaseCommit` writes to both `diff` (captures all changes for state-diff
///   extraction) and `db` (updates state for subsequent txs).
